# Tut exercise
## Question
```
This tutorial is aimed at developing a BETTER test suite based on the above specification of the problem.
That is develop a “BLACK-BOX” inspired test suite along the lines given in the table below.
You are THEN required to develop an algorithm/program to test your earlier program against the
test-suite you have just developed above, while verifying that the results thrown up are indeed correct.
```

### Test  cases to find wther the code is correct or not

`Test case:- 1
`
 To find wether all list are correct or not

```
5
car
socks
Lego
shuttle
erasure
2
3
1
7
5
```
output generated by the code :-
```
271
all 4 4
```
output calculation:-

```
Original Price per Car: ₹9
Discount on Toys: 10%
GST on Toys: 6%
```
```
Discount on the original price of one car (10%):
Discount = Original Price × Discount Rate
Discount = ₹9 × 0.10
Discount = ₹0.90
```
```
GST on the original price of one car (6%):
GST = Original Price × GST Rate
GST = ₹9 × 0.06
GST = ₹0.54
```
Now, we calculate the total discount and GST for 2 cars:

Total Discount = Discount per Car × Number of Cars
Total Discount = ₹0.90 × 2
Total Discount = ₹1.80

Total GST = GST per Car × Number of Cars
Total GST = ₹0.54 × 2
Total GST = ₹1.08

on totaling = 18 + 1.08 - 0.54 =  ₹17.28

 similarly after calculating all ne by one:
```
calculated output:
car - 17.28
socks - 35.879999999999995
Lego - 48
shuttle - 99.12
erasure - 71.25
so total sum is: 271.5299
after the command: print(int(271.5299))
output was 271.
```
 so, it is verified that the bill was correct

and in the second line of the output- `all 4 4`

as specified in the question 

```
We also need to output in which parts the output is given or not. The things you should be mentioning are as follows:

1)The number of items that are present (in any department). You need to specify how many departments each item is present in. If all are present then say all, if n are present them say print number n and if none is present say none.

2)Number of items which have discount on it. If all have discount then say all, if n have discount then print number n and if none have discount say none.

3)Number of items having GST upon itself. If all have then say all, if n have them say print number n and if none have say none.
```

1st part represent wether the product is available so as we can see all products are available in the list

2nd part represent weather the product type have discount on it and in this case 4 out of 5 have discount on it

3rd part represent weather the product type have gst on it and in this case 4 out of 5 have gst on it
